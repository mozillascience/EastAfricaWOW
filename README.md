# Welcome to the East Africa Open Science Tour 2018

This is a repo to collect all materials and resources related to the Open Science trainings tour in East Africa held in November 2018.  You are invited to fork this repo and use our materials-- please let us know what you do with them and how it goes!


#### What is the Working Open Workshop?

**Mozilla Science group** and **H3ABionet** in collaboration with **SageBionetworks** will be running a series of 2 days Open Science trainings hosted by several institutions in East Africa. 
These 2 days trainings aim to raise awareness, increase skills around open research and reproducibility in Science, tools and platforms,  and ultimately help scientist and researchers overcome the fears and challenges.

#### Life After WOW: The Open Leadership Mentors

WOW was designed as a springboard for a group we're calling the Open Leadership Mentors. Members of the Open Leadership Mentors (with the support, advice, and encouragement of Mozilla staff and previously trained mentors) work together to create projects, share resources, and build active, regional communities of open source practitioners. Learn more about the Open Leadership program at their website here: https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/

#### What is "open" research?

Whether you're studying the human genome, black holes, deep-sea ecology, medieval music, or alternative energy sources, research is a practice and process of learning, and creating knowledge. Researchers always build on (or transform) an existing understanding of the world. **A researcher working open shares insights or discoveries freely, makes her data available on the web, or makes the details of a new experimental technique or tool public so others can use and reuse it. By working open, she empowers fellow researchers and furthers our collective knowledge... knowledge that can be used to solve problems, save lives, and inspire and amaze us all.** The more data, knowledge, methods, tools and skills made widely and openly available to all, the better.
